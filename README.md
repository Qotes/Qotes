# Qotes-React

The project is back to the timeline finally.

I was going to build it with vue.js but somehow I changed my idea, since I was going to dive a little deeper at that time when I just came across vue.js. However, since then occupied and familier with it, I guess maybe I just want to try something except from vue.js and AngularJS at present.

Not sure wether to build it with Next.js. I pictured that but it looks too "*dynamic*". I'll try the request API with Next.js and figure out whether it's an acceptable option.

The **Only** things have been confirmed so far are that:

- Working on *Qotes*
- React

The *ambiguous* thing is that:

- Next.js
